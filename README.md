Project Title: Quiz Bee Buzzer Timer and Points System with Host Control

Project Description:

A maximum of 4 players will be chosen to play a quiz game. After the question has been read, the host will start the first timer. For 9 seconds, all players are given a chance to answer the question by pressing the button. The first one to press it would be given 5 seconds to answer. For a correct answer, a point will be granted to the player.  If the player failed to answer correctly, his/her button will be disabled and another chance will be given to other players.

The host would be able to control the game following a few conditions:
	If the player exceeds the time frame, the host will disable the player's buzzer, giving the other players a chance to answer. 
	If the player answers correctly, the host would allot the amount of points to the corresponding player.
	If the player answers incorrectly, the host will restart the timer for other players to answer the question.
